# Voting DApp

This is a simple decentralized application (DApp) built with **React**, **Vite**, and **ethers.js** that allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask), view their account balance, and cast votes using a smart contract deployed on the **Sepolia ETH Test Network**.

## Features
- Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- View your connected account address.
